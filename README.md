========================

Solving [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems in JavaScript. Take a look, but try to solve problems on you own ;) Some guiding ideas:

* For completition, include problem text in `*.js` files.
* No libraries used, single script per problem.
* Run in both Node and browser console (when external files used, run in Node).
